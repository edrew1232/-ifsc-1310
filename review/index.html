            <h2>Progressive Enhancement Writing Assignment</h2>
            <p>For this assignment, I collected feedback from a peer, family member, or a friend on my first attempt at the Dragon or Segway project. Using that feedback, I attempted to address any issues or problems pointed out by potential users. Here's a reflection on my learning experience and the changes I made:</p>

            <!-- Reflection on Learning Experience -->
            <h3>Learning Experience Reflection</h3>
            <p>During this semester, I learned a lot about timing and web development, my focus needed to improve based off of the mistakes I've done including my other classes like coding. My awarness was very off and my remebering of what to do and write was off as well, my understanding of things in css and html were different, unfortunetly hopefully I get an attempt worthy grade.  Overall, I feel like I did well in the creativity and wished i took it beyond and my raw interest to developing things that i want to are there, but there are areas I would improve if I had to start over obviously. This class gave me a perspective I've never saw and i definetly will use everything i learned to move forward with myself and the people around me. The examples you've given that one day about working with others has shown me to pick who you choose to work with and to make sure you do your work so others dont suffer, and so that others should do their work so you dont suffer, but people will be people. Thank you</p>

            <!-- Feedback Received and Changes Made -->
            <h3>Feedback and Changes</h3>
            <p>The feedback I received highlighted my worth, I was lazy and unproductive but creative and had plans, my feedbacks were harsh but reasonable. To address these issues, I will take things a lot more serious especially when dealing with online because it is the key to all the help you need when dealing with difficult things, you have to deal with them personally too but you can use the web as an advantage. Early to bed, early to rise, makes a man young, wealthy and wise.</p>
