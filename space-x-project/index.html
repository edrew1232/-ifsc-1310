      <h2>First Private Spacecraft to the Space Station</h2>
      <p>The Dragon spacecraft is capable of carrying up to 7 passengers to and from Earth orbit, and beyond. It is the only spacecraft currently flying that is capable of returning significant amounts of cargo to Earth, and is the first private spacecraft to take humans to the space station.</p>
      <p>In 2020, SpaceX returned America’s ability to fly NASA astronauts to and from the International Space Station on American vehicles for the first time since 2011. In addition to flying astronauts to space for NASA, SpaceX’s Dragon spacecraft can also carry commercial astronauts to Earth orbit, the ISS or beyond.

      <ul>
        <li>Capabilities-Cargo Dragon can carry 3,307 kg (7,291 lb) to the ISS. Crew Dragon has a capacity of four astronauts. Above the seats, there is a three-screen control panel, a toilet (with privacy curtain), and the docking hatch. </li>
        <li>The SpaceX Dragon cargo spacecraft is primarily constructed using aluminum and other lightweight materials.  Aluminum strength-to-weight ratio is essential in cases like these for its reliability for aerospace applications because every gram counts. Additionally, Dragon's heat shield, which protects it during re-entry into Earth's atmosphere, is made of phenolic impregnated carbon ablator, a type of thermal protecting material.(This benefits the intensity of heat that is generated during re-entry, ensuring the spacecraft as a whole remains safe.)</li>

      <ul>
       <li>Crew-8 is the eighth crew rotation mission of SpaceXs human space transportation system and its ninth flight with astronauts, including the Demo-2 test flight, to the space station through NASAs Commercial Crew Program. Liftoff occurred at 10:53 p.m. EST Sunday, March 3, 2024.(“NASA’s Spacex Crew-8.” NASA, 12 Apr. 2024, www.nasa.gov/mission/nasas-spacex-crew-8/. Accessed 05 May 2024.)</li>
<li>CREW SUITS/ INTRAVEHICULAR ACTIVITY (IVA)|EXTRAVEHICULAR ACTIVITY (EVA)</li>
<li> SpaceX, like other space agencies, provides crew suits for astronauts to wear during space missions. These suits serve different purposes depending on whether the astronauts are inside the spacecraft (IVA) or outside space (EVA). Inside the spacecraft, SpaceX crew suits offer comfort, mobility, and protection, along with more improved communication and interaction with the spacecraft's systems. During extravehicular activities, SpaceX spacesuits are highly specialized garments designed to shield astronauts from the harsh conditions of space while providing life support and mobility to perform tasks outside the spacecraft.</li>

<li>Inside the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft, there's a pressurized crew compartment for astronauts, equipped with seating, controls, and life support systems. Additionally, there's an unpressurized cargo area for transporting supplies and scientific payloads to destinations like the International Space Station. The spacecraft also features docking mechanisms for autonomous rendezvous and docking with the ISS or other spacecraft.</li>
